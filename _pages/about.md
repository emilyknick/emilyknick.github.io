I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://ling.ucsc.edu), advised by [Roumyana Pancheva](https://pancheva.github.io).

My research is primarily focused on <b>semantics</b> and <b>its interfaces</b>. TEST

Before coming to UC Santa Cruz, I completed my B.A. in Linguistics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/linguistics/). I was also lab manager of [XLing (Experimental Linguistics) Laboratories](https://xlingumass.github.io).
