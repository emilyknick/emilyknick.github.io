I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://ling.ucsc.edu), advised by [Amanda Rysling](https://rysling.sites.ucsc.edu).

My research is primarily focused on <b>psycholinguistics</b> and the <b>phonetics-phonology interface</b>. I am interested in how listeners use acoustic information in the speech signal to access phonological representations.

Before coming to UC Santa Cruz, I completed my B.A. in Linguistics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/linguistics/), where I was advised by [John Kingston](https://blogs.umass.edu/jkingstn/). I was also lab manager of [XLing Laboratories](https://xlingumass.github.io).
