As a linguist, I am interested in semantics and its interfaces. Specifically, I investigate the meaning of tense, aspect, and modality across natural language, as well as their interactions with related phenomena like negation. My research has a particular empirical focus on Khalkha Mongolian, informed by my ongoing collection of semantic data in collaboration with native speakers.
