As a linguist, I am interested in semantics and its interfaces. More specifically, I investigate the meaning of <b>tense</b>, <b>aspect</b>, and <b>modality</b>. A belief that is woven into my work is the importance of cross-linguistic insights for semantic theory. My research has a particular empirical focus on Khalkha Mongolian, and I have the ongoing privilege of collecting semantic data in collaboration with native speakers.
