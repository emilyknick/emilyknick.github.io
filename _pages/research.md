I am primarily interested in semantics and its interfaces. My ongoing work focuses on tense, aspect, and modality, as well as their interactions with related phenomena such as negation. I value a cross-linguistic perspective in semantic theory, and my research has a particular empirical focus on Khalkha Mongolian.
