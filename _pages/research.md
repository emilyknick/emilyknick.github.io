I am interested in examining the phonetics-phonology interface using experimental methods. My work investigates both the processes and representations involved in speech perception and lexical access.

<font size="5"><b>How do listeners process the syllable structure of words during lexical access?</b></font><br>
Hierarchical prosodic structure is frequently discussed in phonological theory as a part of phonological representations. However, little experimental work has explored whether and how listeners assign this structure to the acoustic signal during lexical access.<br>

In light of this, I am currently exploring if listeners are performing a real-time assignment of hierarchical prosodic structure to incoming lexical items, as well as what acoustic information listeners are using to do so. In ongoing work with [Amanda Rysling](https://rysling.sites.ucsc.edu), we are investigating right-edge-to-anchor-duration (Durvasula et al., 2021) and offset/onset F2 slope (Modarresi et al., 2004) as possible perceptual correlates to syllable structure.
